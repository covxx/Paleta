# Directory Cleanup Summary

## Overview
The project directory has been reorganized and cleaned up to improve maintainability and reduce clutter.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Organized Directories
- **`/docs/`** - All documentation files moved here
- **`/scripts/`** - All shell scripts and batch files moved here  
- **`/tests/`** - All test and debug files moved here
- **`/configs/`** - All configuration files moved here

### 2. Removed Duplicate Files
**Templates cleaned up:**
- Removed `admin_new.html`, `admin_unified.html`
- Removed `base_header.html`, `base_unified.html`
- Removed `index_new.html`, `label_designer_new.html`, `receiving_new.html`
- Removed `quickbooks_import.html` (replaced by `quickbooks_admin.html`)

**Obsolete files removed:**
- `curl-format.txt`
- `demo_data.py`
- `init_database.py` (kept `init_database_simple.py`)
- `init_db_with_orders.py`
- `init_db_with_performance.py`
- `init_db_with_units.py`
- `manage_changelog.py`
- `requirements-lock.txt`
- `requirements-production.txt`
- `start.py`

### 3. Added Project Management Files
- **`.gitignore`** - Comprehensive ignore rules for Python, Flask, and common files
- **`uploads/.gitkeep`** - Ensures uploads directory is tracked by git
- **`docs/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`** - Documents the new organization

### 4. Directory Structure Benefits
- **Cleaner root directory** - Only essential files remain
- **Better organization** - Related files grouped together
- **Easier maintenance** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Reduced clutter** - No duplicate or obsolete files
- **Better git management** - Proper .gitignore prevents future clutter

## File Count Reduction
- **Before**: ~80+ files in root directory
- **After**: ~10 essential files in root directory
- **Organized**: ~70 files moved to appropriate subdirectories

## Next Steps
1. Update any scripts that reference moved files
2. Update documentation that references old file locations
3. Consider creating additional subdirectories as the project grows
4. Maintain the organized structure going forward
